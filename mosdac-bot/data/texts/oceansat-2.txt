Oceansat-2
Oceansat-2 satellite mainframe systems derive their heritage from previous IRS missions. Oceansat-2 was launched by PSLV-C14 from Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota on Sept. 23, 2009. It carries three payloads: Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM) Ku-band Pencil Beam scatterometer (SCAT) developed by ISRO Radio Occultation Sounder for Atmosphere (ROSA) developed by the Italian Space Agency. Oceansat-2 is envisaged to provide continuity of operational services of Oceansat-1(IRS-P4) with enhanced application potential.

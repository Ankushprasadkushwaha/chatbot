Acq Calendar/Version Product Description Processing Level Temporal Resolution Start Date
1 3DIMG_L1B_STD
Level1 data for Imager 6 channels at half hour interval L1B HALF HOURLY 2013-10-01
2 3DIMG_L1C_ASIA_MER
IMAGER- 6 channel Level1 data in Mercator projection for Asian Sector L1C HALF HOURLY 2013-10-01
3 3DIMG_L1C_SGP
Level1 IMAGER 6 channel data of TIR1, TIR2, WV, VIS, SWIR, MIR Bands in Mercator projection L1C HALF HOURLY 2013-10-01
4 3DIMG_L2B_CMK
INSAT-3D VHRR measures radiances in one visible and one SWIR band at 1 km spatial resolution, one MIR and two TIR bands at 4 km resolution, and one WV band at 8 km resolution. Radiances from 3 IR spectral bands TIR-1 , TIR-2 and MIR which are of same resolution of 4km are used in the INSAT cloud mask algorithm to estimate whether a given view of the earth surface is unobstructed by clouds L2B HALF HOURLY 2013-10-08
5 3DIMG_L2B_CTP
Cloud top properties derived using INSAT3D IMAGER L2B HALF HOURLY 2018-11-30

7 3DIMG_L2B_HEM
This product is derived on the basis of Hydro-Estimator method. It measures precipitation over Indian Region encompassing area between longitudes 30°E -to130°E and latitudes 50°N- 50°S. L2B HALF HOURLY 2013-10-08
8 3DIMG_L2B_IMC
INSAT multispectral Rainfall Algorithm Technique (IMSRA) is one of the main operational rainfall retrieval algorithms for INSAT-3D. This algorithm estimates precipitation based on non-linear power law relationship established between infrared (IR) brightness temperatures (Tbs, 10.7 µm observations) and TRMM-PR surface rain rate. Based on a number of case studies and research works carried out, a further refinement of the algorithm was made. L2B HALF HOURLY 2016-01-01
9 3DIMG_L2B_LST
Land surface temperature (LST) is a key parameter in the land surface processes. LST is very useful input to various models related to agrometeorology, ecology, hydrology and climate. L2B HALF HOURLY 2015-03-04
10 3DIMG_L2B_OLR
Total outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) flux, thermally emitted from earth atmosphere system, is estimated by applying regression equation relating OLR flux with INSAT-3D Imager observed WV (6.7&#956;m) and thermal infrared (TIR-1 10.5 &#956;m and TIR-2 11.5 &#956;m) radiances. The coefficients of the regression equations are determined from results of the Radiative Transfer Model simulation with various atmospheric conditions L2B HALF HOURLY 2013-10-01

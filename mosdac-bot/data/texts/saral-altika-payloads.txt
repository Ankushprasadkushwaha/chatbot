SARAL carries the following four payloads:
Ka-band altimeter with enhanced bandwidth
Ionospheric effects are negligible
Better vertical resolution (0.3m)
Ka-band (35 GHz) authorizes a compact, lightweight instrument easier to accommodate on a wide range of satellite buses.
Dual-frequency radiometer (24/37 GHz)
Required for tropospheric correction
Derived from Madras (Megha-Tropiques) developments.
Laser Retro-reflector Array
Useful for orbitography and system calibration.
DORIS
For adequate orbitography performances in low earth orbit
Enable to have similar performance as reference missions like T/P, JASON, ENVISAT
Required for mean sea level analysis and coastal/inland application.
